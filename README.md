# Client-NBT-Editor
A simple JSON Text NBT editor I made mostly via Antigravity, works for 1.21.11 Minecraft for now. 

There are 2 commands in the mod:
/editnbt - it opens a notepad-like GUI, with the NBT data displayed in JSON text. To see how a item looks like, press the "Preview" button, and click "Save" to save changes after editing the item.
If you edit a item in any slot and press "Save", the new item will be put into the most left slot in the inventory. I will fix that soon.
/seestorage is a normal container preview command, it will be possible to change item locations soon.
More features to be added in the near future.

The mod REQUIRES Java 25 and Fabric version 0.18.4+.
